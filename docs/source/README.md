## Online Access

üü¢  <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/MannLabs/OmicLearn/OmicLearn/OmicLearn.py" target="_blank"> Streamlit share</a>

This is an online version hosted by streamlit using free cloud resources, which might have limited performance. Use the local installation to run OmicLearn on your own hardware.

## Local Installation

### One-click Installation

You can use the one-click installer to install OmicLearn as an application locally.
Click on one of the links below to download the latest release for:

- [**Windows**](https://github.com/MannLabs/OmicLearn/releases/latest/download/omiclearn_gui_installer_windows.exe)
- [**macOS**](https://github.com/MannLabs/OmicLearn/releases/latest/download/omiclearn_gui_installer_macos.pkg) 
- [**Linux**](https://github.com/MannLabs/OmicLearn/releases/latest/download/omiclearn_gui_installer_linux.deb)

For detailed installation instructions of the one-click installers refer to the [documentation](https://OmicLearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ONE_CLICK.html).

### Python Installation

- It is strongly recommended to install OmicLearn in its own environment using [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

  1. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/OmicLearn
    ```
    
  2. Create a new environment for OmicLearn: 
    ```bash
    conda create --name OmicLearn python=3.10 -y
    ```
  3. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate OmicLearn
    ```
  4. Change to the OmicLearn directory and install OmicLearn:
    ```bash
    cd OmicLearn
    pip install .
    ```

- After a successful installation, type the following command to run OmicLearn:

  ```bash
  python -m omiclearn
  ```

 - After starting the streamlit server, the OmicLearn page should be automatically opened in your browser (Default link: [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501)
