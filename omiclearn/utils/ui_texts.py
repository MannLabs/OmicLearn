**⚠️ Warning:** It is possible to get artificially high or low performance because of technical and biological artifacts in the data.
While OmicLearn has the functionality to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) such as PCA, 
it is not meant to substitute throughout data exploration but rather add a machine learning layer.
Please check our [recommendations](https://OmicLearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RECOMMENDATIONS.html) 
page for potential pitfalls and interpret performance metrics accordingly.

PACKAGES_PLAIN_TEXT = """
OmicLearn ({OmicLearn_version}) was utilized for performing data analysis, model execution, and creation of plots and charts.
Machine learning was done in Python ({python_version}). 
Feature tables were imported via the Pandas package ({pandas_version}) and manipulated using the Numpy package ({numpy_version}).
The machine learning pipeline was employed using the scikit-learn package ({sklearn_version}).
The Plotly ({plotly_version}) library was used for plotting.

SUBSET_TEXT = """This section allows you to specify a subset of data based on values within a comma.
Hence, you can exclude data that should not be used at all."""

CLASSIFICATION_TARGET_TEXT = """
Classification target refers to the column that contains the variables that are used two distinguish the two classes.
In the next section, the unique values of this column can be used to define the two classes.
"""

DEFINE_CLASS_TEXT = """
For a binary classification task, one needs to define two classes based on the
unique values in the **`{STATE_TARGET_COLUMN}`** task column.
It is possible to assign multiple values for each class.

EXCLUDE_FEATURES_TEXT = """Exclude some features from the model training by selecting or uploading a CSV file.
This can be useful when, e.g., re-running a model without a top feature and assessing the difference in classification accuracy.
